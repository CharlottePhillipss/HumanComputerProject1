Team members:

Josephine Willgrubs - Team Leader (Base Interface Design)

Chloe Osgood - Programmer (Base Interface Design)

Josephine and Chloe will be implementing the base interface design, which includes the menu the applications are in and the windows the applications the windows will run in on the mirror. They will also be implementing the Health Tracker application, which will include health statistics like the user's current weight and how long the user slept the previous night.

Aishwarya Anand - Programmer (Clock Display and Weather Display)
Aishwarya will be working on the Clock display (a digital clock showing hour, minute and seconds)  and the weather information. These would be implemented using the p5.js library of processing and HTML5.

Charlotte Phillips - Programmer (Music and Calendar functions)
Charlotte will be designing and implementing the music player. The user can play music they have uploaded into the mirror. The player will be implemention using the p5.js library.

Donald Soundy - Programmer (News functions)
Donald will be implementing a switch that will clear the mirror of all applications so the users may attend to themselves unperturbed. 
There will be an additional function that brings back the applications upon pressing the button again.

Objective:
The interactive mirror is a website that mimics the operations of a personal mirror with interactive features. These include:

- A digital clock
- Weather display
- Main menu with access to:
    1. Music Player
    2. News Feed
    3. Calendar

Feedback: We recieved feedback that stated our mirror design was too minimal and did not need to resemble an iphone. We took these comments into account when designing our interface. For our final design, the calendar and news functionalities will be displayed by default instead of accessible through the menu.

## Principles and Golden rules
Principles <br>

Our mirror's main principle is direct manipulation. Users should be able to directly press on the mirror to select the appplication, and drag the icons to the desired location. This allows the program to be easily learned as this intuitive display is used on smartphones. The difficult of this principle is the graphical implementation. Compared to other principles like form filling or command language (where the users have more control in their choices) graphical displays are difficult and time consuming to create.

<br>

Golden Rule <br>

The golden rules we mainly considered are striving for consistancy and reducing short term memory load. Our icons and text are consistent and add the usability by being a familiar set up, so anyone can start using it right away. To reduce short term memory load we limited the amount of items on the screen to 8. On the left side the weather is always displayed and the user can add three more applications to the left. On the right side the time and the date are always displayed and user can add three additional items to the side. No more icons can be added to keep the short term memory load low and so the displayed applications don't become too small to be seen and used.

<br>

The menu is also ordered by most frequently used so the user can easily access frequently used applications.
